# HIRE AI

> **Smarter Applications. Stronger Chances.**

HIRE AI is an in-progress, AI-powered career platform designed to help college students—starting with STEM majors—match with internships and jobs they are *actually qualified for*. Built with a data-driven approach, HIRE calculates real match probabilities based on your resume, GPA, skills, and goals—then gives you personalized recommendations to boost your chances.

## 🚧 Project Status: `In Development`

This project is currently in the early stages of development. We're building out the MVP as part of a university capstone, and actively scoping out the architecture, components, and core user workflows.

Follow along and ⭐️ this repo to watch the journey as we go from **student side project** to **full-scale startup.**

## 🧠 The Problem We're Solving

Too many students apply to dozens of internships or jobs and hear nothing back.

Platforms like LinkedIn and Handshake don’t provide real feedback, strategic guidance, or personalized insight. Most applicants are left in the dark, applying blindly.

**HIRE AI is changing that.**

---

## 🎯 Our Mission

> Help students stop applying blindly and start applying strategically.

We aim to:
- Show users the **real probability** of landing a job before applying
- Provide **feedback** on how to improve their chances
- Track application outcomes to make our AI smarter over time
- Empower students from non-target schools who are often overlooked
